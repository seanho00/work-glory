## Aspire to be a **fool**, <br/> not a professional

## Work to train your **heart**

## Toil for God's kingdom <br/> by resting in His **victory**

If innovation is purely **market driven**, <br/>
we could have amazing advances in **inventions** <br/>
that leave the world even **more divided**.

---
If we have **optimism** <br/>
but we don't have **empathy**, <br/>
it doesnt matter how much <br/>
we master the **secrets of science** --

We're not really **solving problems**, <br/>
we're just working on **puzzles**.

## Work for the Glory of God
1. The Snare of **Professionalism**
1. The Blessing of **Employment**
1. The Grace of **God's Work**

---
## 1. The Snare of Professionalism
1. Chasing the **Guild**
1. Building **Ambition**
1. Earning **Wages**

---
God has chosen the **foolish** things of the world <br/>
to shame the **wise**, <br/>
and God has chosen <br/>
the **weak** things of the world <br/>
to shame the things which are **strong**,

---
and the **base** things of the world <br/>
and the **despised** God has chosen, <br/>
the things that are **not**, <br/>
so that He may **nullify** the things that are,

so that **no man may boast** before God.

Truly, truly, I say to you, you are **seeking me**, <br/>
not because you saw **signs**, <br/>
but because you **ate your fill** of the loaves.

Do not work for the food that **perishes**, <br/>
but for the food that **endures** to eternal life, <br/>
which the **Son of Man** will give to you. <br/>
For on him God the Father has set his **seal**.

<div class="caption">

Then they said to him, <br/>
“What must we **do**, <br/>
to be doing the **works of God**?”

Jesus answered them, <br/>
“**This** is the work of God: <br/>
that you **believe in Him** whom he has **sent**.

<div class="caption">
(John 6:28-29, ESV)
</div>

---
Who is **wise** and **understanding** among you? <br/>
By his **good conduct** let him show his **works** <br/>
in the **meekness** of wisdom.

But if you have bitter **jealousy** <br/>
and selfish **ambition** in your hearts, <br/>
do not **boast** and be false to the truth.

This is **not** the wisdom <br/>
that comes down from above, <br/>
but is **earthly**, unspiritual, demonic.

“Abraham **believed God**, <br/>
and it was counted to him as **righteousness**.”

Now to the one who works, his **wages** <br/>
are not counted as a **gift** but as his **due**.

And to the one who **does not work** <br/>
but **believes** in him who **justifies** the ungodly, <br/>
his **faith** is counted as righteousness.

## 2. The Blessing of Employment
1. Rejecting **Idleness**
1. **Sharing** Generously
1. Training our **Heart** Attitude

---
For you yourselves know <br/>
how you ought to **imitate** us,

because we were **not idle** <br/>
when we were with you, <br/>
nor did we eat anyone's **bread** <br/>
without paying for it,

but with **toil** and **labor** <br/>
we worked night and day, <br/>
that we might not be a **burden** to any of you.

<div class="caption">
(2 Thessalonians 3:7-8, ESV)
</div>

---
If anyone is not willing to **work**, let him not **eat**.

For we hear that some among you <br/>
walk in **idleness**, <br/>
not busy at work, but **busybodies**.

Now such persons we command and encourage <br/>
in the Lord Jesus Christ <br/>
to do their **work quietly** <br/>
and to earn their **own living**.

## 2. The Blessing of Employment
1. Rejecting Idleness
1. **Sharing Generously**
1. Training our Heart Attitude

---
Let the **thief** no longer steal,

but rather let him **labor**, <br/>
doing **honest work** with his **own hands**,

so that he may have something to **share** <br/>
with anyone in **need**.

## 2. The Blessing of Employment
1. Rejecting Idleness
1. Sharing Generously
1. **Training our Heart Attitude**

---
**Slaves**, in all things <br/>
**obey** those who are your masters on earth,

not with **external** service, <br/>
as those who merely **please men**,

but with **sincerity** of heart, <br/>
**fearing the Lord**.

But the **day of the Lord** will come like a thief, <br/>
in which the **heavens** will <br/>
**pass away** with a roar <br/>
and the **elements** will <br/>
be **destroyed** with intense heat, <br/>
and the **earth** and its **works** will be **burned up**.

<div class="caption">
(2 Peter 3:10, NASB)
</div>

---
Since all these things <br/>
are to be **destroyed** in this way,

what sort of people ought you to be <br/>
in **holy conduct** and **godliness**, <br/>
looking for and **hastening** <br/>
the coming of the day of God!

## 3. The Grace of God's Work
1. Welcoming His Return
1. **Steadfast because of His Victory**

---
When the perishable puts on the **imperishable**, <br/>
and the mortal puts on **immortality**, <br/>

then shall come to pass <br/>
the saying that is written: <br/>

“**Death** is swallowed up in **victory**.”

---
“O death, **where** is your victory? <br/>
O death, **where** is your sting?”

The sting of death is **sin**, <br/>
and the power of sin is the **law**.

<div class="caption">
(1 Corinthians 15:54-56, ESV)
</div>

---
But thanks be to God, who gives us <br/>
the **victory** through our Lord **Jesus** Christ.

Therefore, my beloved brothers, <br/>
be **steadfast**, **immovable**, <br/>
always abounding in the **work of the Lord**,

knowing that in the Lord <br/>
your labor is **not in vain**.
