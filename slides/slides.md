If innovation is purely **market driven**, <br/>
we could have amazing advances in **inventions** <br/>
that leave the world even **more divided**.

---
If we have **optimism** <br/>
but we don't have **empathy**, <br/>
it doesnt matter how much <br/>
we master the **secrets of science** --

We're not really **solving problems**, <br/>
we're just working on **puzzles**.

God has chosen the **foolish** things of the world <br/>
to shame the **wise**, <br/>
and God has chosen <br/>
the **weak** things of the world <br/>
to shame the things which are **strong**,

---
and the **base** things of the world <br/>
and the **despised** God has chosen, <br/>
the things that are **not**, <br/>
so that He may **nullify** the things that are,

so that **no man may boast** before God.

Truly, truly, I say to you, you are **seeking me**, <br/>
not because you saw **signs**, <br/>
but because you **ate your fill** of the loaves.

Do not work for the food that **perishes**, <br/>
but for the food that **endures** to eternal life, <br/>
which the **Son of Man** will give to you. <br/>
For on him God the Father has set his **seal**.

Then they said to him, <br/>
“What must we **do**, <br/>
to be doing the **works of God**?”

Jesus answered them, <br/>
“**This** is the work of God: <br/>
that you **believe in Him** whom he has **sent**.

Who is **wise** and **understanding** among you? <br/>
By his **good conduct** let him show his **works** <br/>
in the **meekness** of wisdom.

But if you have bitter **jealousy** <br/>
and selfish **ambition** in your hearts, <br/>
do not **boast** and be false to the truth.

This is **not** the wisdom <br/>
that comes down from above, <br/>
but is **earthly**, unspiritual, demonic.

“Abraham **believed God**, <br/>
and it was counted to him as **righteousness**.”

Now to the one who works, his **wages** <br/>
are not counted as a **gift** but as his **due**.

And to the one who **does not work** <br/>
but **believes** in him who **justifies** the ungodly, <br/>
his **faith** is counted as righteousness.
