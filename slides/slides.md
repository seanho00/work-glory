# Work for the <br/> Glory of God
## 1 Corinthians 1:27-29

>>>
+ not as **exegetical** as usual:
  + not based on a **single** passage
  + but my **heartfelt** advice
  + based on **Scripture** and **experience**
+ Christian **perspective** on work
  + for those who have or will have **jobs**
  + particularly if **successful** in career
+ Both **pitfalls** and **purpose** in work
+ 3 main points:

---
<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
## Aspire to be a **fool**, <br/> not a professional
<!-- .element: style="text-align:left" -->
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Work to train your **heart**
<!-- .element: style="text-align:right" -->
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Toil for God's kingdom <br/> by resting in His **victory**
<!-- .element: style="text-align:left" -->

>>>
+ pitfall: **snare** of professionalism
+ purpose: **blessing** of having employment
+ peace: finding **grace** in working for God
+ First, a **quote** not from Scripture
  + but from billionaire innovator **Bill Gates**:

---
"If innovation is purely **market driven**, <br/>
we could have amazing advances in **inventions** <br/>
that leave the world even **more divided**....

"If we have **optimism** <br/>
but we don't have **empathy**,

it doesnt matter how much <br/>
we master the **secrets of science** --

we're not really **solving problems**, <br/>
we're just working on **puzzles**."

God has chosen <br/>
the **foolish** things of the world <br/>
to shame the **wise** ...

the things that are **not**, <br/>
so that He may **nullify** the things that are,

so that **no man may boast** before God.

Therefore I will **boast** all the more gladly <br/>
of my **weaknesses**,

so that the **power of Christ** <br/>
may rest upon me.

Then they said to him, <br/>
“What must we **do**, <br/>

Jesus answered them, <br/>
“**This** is the work of God: <br/>

Who is **wise** and **understanding** among you? <br/>
By his **good conduct** let him show his **works** <br/>

---
But if you have bitter **jealousy** <br/>
and selfish **ambition** in your hearts, <br/>
do not **boast** and be false to the truth.

This is **not** the wisdom <br/>
that comes down from above,

but is **earthly**, unspiritual, demonic.

“Abraham **believed God**, <br/>
and it was counted to him as **righteousness**.”

Now to the one who works, his **wages** <br/>
are not counted as a **gift** but as his **due**.

And to the one who **does not work** <br/>
but **believes** in him who **justifies** the ungodly, <br/>
his **faith** is counted as righteousness.

For you yourselves know <br/>
how you ought to **imitate** us,

because we were **not idle** <br/>
when we were with you, ...

but with **toil** and **labor** <br/>
we worked night and day, <br/>
that we might not be a **burden** to any of you.

If anyone is not willing to **work**, let him not **eat**.

For we hear that some among you <br/>
walk in **idleness**, <br/>
not busy at work, but **busybodies**.

Now such persons we command <br/>
and encourage in the Lord Jesus Christ

to do their **work quietly** <br/>
and to earn their **own living**.

He who supplies **seed** to the sower  <br/>

to be **generous** in every way,

which through us will produce <br/>
**thanksgiving** to God

**Slaves**, in all things <br/>
**obey** those who are your masters on earth,

But the **day of the Lord** will come like a thief,

in which the **heavens** will <br/>
**pass away** with a roar

and the **elements** will <br/>
be **destroyed** with intense heat,

and the **earth** and its **works** will be **burned up**.

<div class="caption">

Since all these things <br/>
are to be **destroyed** in this way,

what sort of people ought you to be <br/>

looking for and **hastening** <br/>
the coming of the day of God!

---
When the perishable puts on the **imperishable**, <br/>
and the mortal puts on **immortality**,

then shall come to pass <br/>
the saying that is written:

“**Death** is swallowed up in **victory**.”

---
“O death, **where** is your victory? <br/>
O death, **where** is your sting?”

The sting of death is **sin**, <br/>
and the power of sin is the **law**.

<div class="caption">
(1 Corinthians 15:54-56, ESV)
</div>

---
But thanks be to God, who gives us <br/>
the **victory** through our Lord **Jesus** Christ.

Therefore, my beloved brothers, <br/>
be **steadfast**, **immovable**, <br/>
always abounding in the **work of the Lord**,

knowing that in the Lord <br/>
your labor is **not in vain**.
